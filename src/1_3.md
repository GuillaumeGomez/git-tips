#Git tips
##Rewrite a project history

Before going any further, I need to warn you: All changes are __definitive__! Once again, be very careful when using this.

###Fear git rebase!

Yes, once again, this is `git rebase` which allows to do it. When you're using the interactive option ("-i" for those who didn't read the previous chapter) you can do a lot of things. For example, you can switch the order of a few commits or even delete some! Since there isn't much to tell, I'll provide a quick example:

We start a rebase:

```Shell
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

We now have the following screen:

We switch the two commits:

We save and close. Then we need to push the changes on the repository. Once again, I warn you (like I already did in the previous chapter): we'll use the force-push option so be very __careful__!

```Shell
git push -f origin HEAD:the_branch_I_want_to_push_on
```

That's it!
